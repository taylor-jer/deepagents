Source Material: Organizational Theory, Design, and Change (Chapters 1–14)

Module 1: The Machine
Metaphor Context:
This module views the organization as a rational, engineered mechanism designed to achieve specific goals. Just as a machine consists of interlocking parts, an organization consists of roles and departments. The primary focus is on efficiency, control, and reliability. Problems are viewed as "engineering breakdowns" where the structure needs to be tuned or redesigned to reduce friction and maximize output.
(Covers: Ch 1 Effectiveness, Ch 4 Design Challenges, Ch 5 Hierarchy)
Discussion Questions:
Does the Structure Actually Help the Work?
Look at the simple path of how this company creates value (taking resources $\rightarrow$ making something $\rightarrow$ selling it). Now look at all the departments and job titles they have created. Do all these separate specialized roles actually make that work easier, or do they just add unnecessary complexity?
Hierarchy vs. Agility
Analyze the organization's shape—is it tall (many layers) or flat? Does this specific shape impact the organization's ability to meet its current effectiveness challenges? Does the hierarchy act as a necessary control mechanism or a bottleneck preventing speed?
The Balancing Act: Centralization & Competence
Identify the organization's core competences. To protect or leverage these competences, has the organization chosen to centralize or decentralize authority? Discuss whether the current allocation of decision-making authority helps the organization manage its hierarchy effectively or if it creates coordination problems.
Integration in a Bureaucracy
If the organization is highly differentiated (specialized roles and divisions), what specific integrating mechanisms (e.g., liaisons, teams, or standard rules) are used to glue it back together? Do these mechanisms rely more on standardization (rules) or mutual adjustment (social interaction)?
The Verdict: Mechanistic vs. Organic Fit
Based on your analysis of the goals, the hierarchy, and the design challenges, would you classify this organization as Mechanistic (rigid) or Organic (flexible)? Does this classification "fit" the organization's current problems—for example, is it a mechanistic structure trying to solve organic innovation problems?

Module 2: The Organism
Metaphor Context:
This module treats the organization as a living entity embedded in a wider ecosystem. Like a biological organism, the organization has a life cycle (birth, growth, decline) and "needs" (resources) that it must satisfy to survive. The focus shifts from internal efficiency to external adaptation. Success is defined by the ability to evolve in response to a changing environment.
(Covers: Ch 3 Environment, Ch 9 Technology, Ch 11 Life Cycle)
Discussion Questions:
The Habitat: Uncertainty & Survival
Every organism lives in an ecosystem. Analyze the "habitat" of your company (its specific and general environment). Is this environment rich (lots of resources) or poor? Is it stable or dynamic? How much uncertainty does this create for the organization's survival?
Feeding the Organism: Resource Dependence
Organisms need food (resources) to survive. Who does your organization rely on for its most critical resources (suppliers, partners, investors)? What linkage mechanisms (e.g., long-term contracts, alliances, or mergers) has it evolved to ensure a steady supply of these resources and minimize its dependence on others?
Anatomy & Function: The Technology Fit
An organism’s body must fit its lifestyle. Look at the company’s "technology" (how it converts inputs to outputs). Is the work routine and predictable (mass production) or complex and variable (craftswork/R&D)? Does the organization’s structure fit this technology?
Growth Pains: Greiner’s Life Cycle
Organisms grow and age. Using Greiner’s Model of Growth, identify which stage of life the organization is currently in (e.g., Creativity, Direction, Delegation). What specific "crisis" (e.g., crisis of autonomy, crisis of control) is it currently facing that it must overcome to grow to the next stage?
Adaptation or Extinction: Signs of Decline
Evolution requires adaptation. Is the organization currently showing any symptoms of decline (e.g., "blinded" to problems or taking "faulty action")? Is it successfully adapting to changes in its environment, or is it suffering from organizational inertia (inability to change) that might lead to its "death"?
