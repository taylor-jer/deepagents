Two years ago, BatteryCo was born out of a technical breakthrough at the University of Springfield.

Originally, the company operated as a small, informal team born from a technical breakthrough. During this phase, there was no formal hierarchy or defined job titles; the founders made all decisions together through "pure instinct" and constant communication. The primary strategy was to be as flexible as possible and do anything to get revenue to keep the company running.
